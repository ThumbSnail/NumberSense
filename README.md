Based on [Magoosh's Number Sense](http://magoosh.com/gmat/2012/number-sense-for-the-gmat/).

Using the four randomly picked digits, you want to create an expression that evaluates to an
integer between 1 and 20 via any combination of the following operators:

 * addition +
 * subtraction -
 * multiplication *
 * division /
 * parentheses ()
 * Note: operators can be repeated. Ex: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4

Example: Given the digits 1 2 3 4, one possible expression that evaluates to 9 is: 4 * (2 + 1) - 3.

All solutions for each integer are presented in a bar chart.  Click on any bar to see a list of
those solutions.
